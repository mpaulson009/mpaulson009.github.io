                            My name is Michael Paulson. I am currently seeking an internship in programming/software development, I have a work history in IT and management. I have a passion for problem-solving, efficiency, and innovative design. I am currently studying computer science with a concentration in business administration at Texas State University.  I enjoy working with small business owners helping them to brainstorm new ideas and spot inefficiencies. I hope to one day combine my love of small business and my knowledge as a computer scientist.
