                        <p class = description>

                            Working at Square Cow Moovers taught me the definetion of hard work. When I first moved to Austin, a friend connected me with the company for what was supposed to be short-term job. <br>
                            I had been working with them for just a couple months, with many 80-hour weeks under my belt, when the owners asked if I would be interested in taking an office position. Fast-forward a few years/promotions and I was opening up a new branch of the company with almost complete control of the plans and operations. I loved the creative problem solving and the trust the owners had in my to make the right decisions. However, as I was about to move out to Colorado to begin opening another branch, I saw my future, and I had a change of heart.
